# Architecture

## Overview

Cloneathon-chat is a modern real-time chat application that integrates AI capabilities for enhanced conversation experiences. The application allows users to engage in conversations with AI models, manage documents, and collaborate in a multi-modal environment. Key features include:

- User authentication and account management
- Real-time chat with AI assistants
- Document creation, editing, and management
- Multi-modal interactions supporting text, code, and images
- Suggestion system for content improvement
- Chat history and conversation management
- Public and private visibility settings for chats

The application serves as a platform for interactive AI-assisted communication, document collaboration, and knowledge management in a chat-centric interface. It leverages modern web technologies to provide a responsive, accessible, and feature-rich user experience.

## Architecture

The application follows a modern, layered architecture based on Next.js App Router pattern combined with a client-server model. The architecture can be described as:

### Architectural Pattern

The application uses a **layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components and Next.js pages
2. **Application Layer**: Route handlers, server actions, and client-side logic
3. **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and data models
4. **Data Access Layer**: Database operations via Drizzle ORM
5. **Infrastructure Layer**: External services and AI integrations

The application also incorporates aspects of:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: UI is built from reusable, composable components
- **API-First Design**: Backend functionality is exposed through well-defined API endpoints
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Code is organized by feature rather than technical function

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Next.js App Router**: For modern routing, server components, and improved SEO
2. **Server Actions**: For secure server-side mutations directly from client components
3. **PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM**: For type-safe database access and schema management
4. **NextAuth**: For secure authentication and session management
5. **AI SDK Integration**: For seamless AI model interactions

## Components

The application is organized into several core components and modules:

### Frontend Components

1. **Authentication Components** (`app/(auth)/*`)
   - Login and signup pages with form validation
   - Session management and protected routes
   - OAuth provider integration

2. **Chat Interface** (`components/chat.tsx` and related components)
   - Message display and conversation threading
   - Input handling and response streaming
   - Message actions (editing, deletion, reactions)

3. **Document Management** (`components/document*.tsx`)
   - Document creation and editing interfaces
   - Different editor types (text, code, image)
   - Version control and collaboration features

4. **UI Components** (`components/ui/*`)
   - Reusable UI elements (buttons, cards, inputs)
   - Layout components and styling utilities
   - Responsive design elements

5. **Navigation and Structure** (`components/app-sidebar.tsx`, etc.)
   - Application navigation and routing
   - History management and sidebar components
   - User preferences and settings

### Backend Modules

1. **Authentication System** (`lib/auth/*`)
   - User authentication logic
   - Session management and token handling
   - Password encryption and security

2. **Database Layer** (`lib/db/*`)
   - Schema definitions and migrations
   - Query functions and data access patterns
   - Relationship management between entities

3. **AI Integration** (`lib/ai/*`)
   - AI model connections and configurations
   - Prompt handling and response processing
   - Stream management for real-time AI responses

4. **Artifact Management** (`lib/artifacts/*`)
   - Document and file handling
   - Storage integration and retrieval
   - Metadata management for various artifact types

5. **API Routes** (`app/(chat)/api/*`)
   - RESTful endpoints for data access
   - Webhook handlers and external integrations
   - Authentication middleware for protected routes

## Workflow

The application follows several key workflows that define the user experience:

### Authentication Flow

1. User accesses the application and is directed to login/signup if not authenticated
2. Credentials are validated and a session is established
3. Next.js middleware protects routes from unauthorized access
4. Session state is maintained via NextAuth and cookies

### Chat Interaction Flow

1. User creates or selects an existing chat
2. User inputs a message or query
3. The message is sent to the appropriate AI model via AI SDK
4. Responses are streamed back in real-time
5. Messages are persisted to the database
6. Chat history is updated and accessible for future reference

### Document Management Flow

1. User creates or opens a document (text, code, or image)
2. Document is rendered with the appropriate editor
3. Changes are saved automatically or manually
4. Documents are linked to users and can be shared
5. Suggestions can be added, reviewed, and resolved

### Data Flow

1. **Client to Server**: 
   - Form submissions and user interactions
   - Real-time updates via fetch requests or server actions
   - File uploads and document changes

2. **Server to Database**:
   - CRUD operations via Drizzle ORM
   - Transaction management for complex operations
   - Data validation and sanitization

3. **Server to AI Services**:
   - Prompt construction and contextual information
   - Stream handling for real-time responses
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

4. **Server to Client**:
   - Initial page data via SSR/SSG
   - Real-time updates via streaming responses
   - State synchronization and notifications

## Dependencies
